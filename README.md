# FoundU - Lost UCard Finder App

FoundU is a full-stack mobile application designed to help recover lost university identification cards (UCards) for students. The app enables users to take a photo of a found UCard, automatically detect the student's name using Google Vision API, and then notify the rightful owner by email. Using Puppeteer, the app automates the process of extracting email addresses from a university directory.
